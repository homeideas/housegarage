<p>Sometimes when a garage door panel gets damaged you are able to replace just one of them instead of the whole door. Usually just one or a few panels need to be replaced. Sometimes garage door panel replacement is all thats needed. If maintaining the curb-appeal of your home is very important to you replacing just one garage door panel may not be the best option. The good news is that more often than not you can replace the damaged garage door panel section without having to replace the entire door.</p>

Can I Replace My Damaged Garage Door Panel Garage Door Replacement Garage Door Panels Garage Door Panel Replacement</p>
<p>Yes you can replace one panel of a garage door as long as it is in good condition and has been maintained properly. However sometimes all it takes is repairing or replacing a specific part of the door such as the spring or panels. Slight scuffs or scratches in the paint. The answer is yes. Even if it happens do not panic - it does not mean you have to spend a lot of money and buy a new garage door.</p>
