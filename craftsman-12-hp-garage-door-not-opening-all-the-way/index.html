<p>I have unplugged re-plugged in switched off breaker in basement checked to see if the lights are aligned one is green one is yellow. It doesnt matter what remote you. Had a 15 year old Craftsman 12 HP garage door opener that would open with remote and panel but would not close with the remote. I noticed that the bulb on the garage opener turned on when it opened or closed. Sometimes it will open all the way.</p>

Each of the several models of the Craftsman 12 HP garage door opener is operated by a chain drive.</p>
