How To Replace A Garage Door Opener Battery Repair Guide</p>
<p>I had exactly the same issue door would roll down about a third of the way and stop. If your LiftMaster Garage door system has a battery back up you should replace the battery every 1 2 years. Thats a question people ask themselves. Maybe you put oil on the weatherstripping but your garage door still. Because of the limited power in the battery some features like the garage door opener light will not work.</p>
