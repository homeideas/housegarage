<p>The safety sensors are blocked. Opening and closing of garage doors by themselves are known as phantom operations and this happens because of faulty circuit boards and wiring of the garage door mechanism system. If the door is working properly it should be easy to lift by hand. The safety sensors are blocked. Inspect the Control Wiring.</p>
