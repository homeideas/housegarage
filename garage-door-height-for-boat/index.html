<p>For a double garage door the standard is 16 feet for width and 8 feet tall. In the event you are adding a door to a garage without one you will need to carefully measure the width and height of the opening. Larger doors are common and available for garages which are intended to house vans SUVs boats RVs or heavy work trucks. These boats are about 76 while my garage door is 7. If the garage was flat with the driveway I would not have the clearence.</p>

<p>Please comment with any questions. The standard size of a triple car garage door is 36 feet to 40 feet wide and 8 feet in height. If you are thinking about RV or boat storage then you should consider the RV garage door sizes. If playback doesnt begin shortly try restarting your device. You dont even notice the size diff when looking at front of house.</p>

<p>RV and mobile home have a considerable height difference compared to cars and vans with most models measuring up to 13 feet high. Standard RV garage door sizes range from 12 feet to 14 feet wide and 14 feet to 16 feet high. If you opt for a roll up door you would need an extra 1 of clearance above the opening for the canister. If I had it to do over again 8 tall garage door for 8 power pole. When we built our lake house the garage did face the street so we went with a 10 wide by 8h door on the boat side and a 9 x 8 on the truck side.</p>
