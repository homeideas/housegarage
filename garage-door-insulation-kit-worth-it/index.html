Another benefit of an insulated garage door is added durability. It all depends on how well the rest of your garage is insulated. Since your door needs to stand up to cars kids and equipment this added durability makes sense. During the summer your central AC will run longer trying to cool the extra space.</p>

<p>After the install it brought it down about 12 degrees. Since your door needs to stand up to cars kids and equipment this added durability makes sense. An insulated garage door can also provide excellent sound insulation. I had turned half my garage into a garage gym and temps mid-day in August would get up to 112-114 in there. Some wear and tear on your insulation is expected after its been installed for a while but with this kit on my garage door it took a while for visible damage to show up.</p>

<p>There are many cost-effective garage door insulation solutions but you have to consider the status of the garage walls windows ceiling floor and doors to decide if garage door insulation is worth. Any little bit of insulation helps. An insulated garage door has both health and financial benefits. After the install it brought it down about 12 degrees. Because the garage either attached or detached is one of the most significant heat loss areas of your home your energy bills can skyrocket in the winter.</p>
