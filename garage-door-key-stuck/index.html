<p>When you dont have the luxury of a ready supply of lubricant these other tricks may work. Have a quick check here for obvious signs of rust and try cleaning up as much as possible to see if this rectifies your problem. Check the lock to see. Next start by spraying the lock and stuck key liberally with the lubricant to loosen all components. Its something that you need to install as an additional measure outside.</p>

<p>If the garage door is not controlled by an electric garage door opener and it is unlocked but still seems stuck then it probably is due to the garage door springs having failed. Its something that you need to install as an additional measure outside. When a key is stuck in a pin-tumbler lock what that usually means is that one of the pins has dropped down into the keys cuts but isnt lifting back out of the way so the key can be withdrawn. You should properly lubricate your garage doors track the opener chain and the springs every few months as part of regular preventative maintenance. When a key gets stuck in a lock its usually because the key or the lock mechanism needs lubrication.</p>
