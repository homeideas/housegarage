Another possibility is that if new hardware was installed for the garage doors that a screw or anchor may have penetrated a wire inside a wall. Energizing the wire to the light merely increases the noise masking a weak signal. If the light is still not coming on it could be the light socket or the logic board.</p>

<p>This message is an indication that the battery in the door sensor is low and the battery needs to be replaced. For people who do not know the transmitter has the yellow light and the receiving sensor has the green light. If the light is still not coming on it could be the light socket or the logic board. The problem could be a defect in the remotes or a degradation of the receiver circuit or both. Heres what to do.</p>

<p>Garage door sensors utilize a photo-eye sensor and a beam of infrared light that goes between the two units. If the light is still not coming on it could be the light socket or the logic board. The problem could be a defect in the remotes or a degradation of the receiver circuit or both. This light should always be on unless it is not. If the sending sensor is not working properly the green light on the receiving sensor will remain off.</p>
