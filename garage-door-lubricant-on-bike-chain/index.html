It prevents further rust and corrosion and sheds contaminants like mud grass and water. This saves you effort in re-lubricating your chain. A garage door chain is the same as a motorcycle chain just doesnt run as fast. Unlike dry chain lubricant this type of chain lube can last a bit longer usually at least 1500 kilometres even in rain and mud.</p>

<p>Typically once or twice a year of lubrication work will keep the chain perfect for opening or closing the door. Lubricate the top rail where the chain rides of your garage door with a rag spreading the grease around evenly. I grew up and only knew about WD-40 because thats what my Dad put on my. I would use WD40 on the rollers since you can spray into the bearings and either that or 3 in 1 on the chain or the special lube as mentioned previously. However as silicone spray has a chance of getting washed out it would be better for you to get a special bike chain lube if you ride frequently.</p>
