Dealing With Heavy Garage Doors</p>
<p>It is very common for circuit boards to fail during storms or power outages. When garage door opener capacitors fail the door wont have any motion when you press the start button. When you find that your garage door motor is making a humming noise but not opening and closing it typically means that it has gone off track or needs some sort of small adjustment. You may see the rack along the inside of the rail of the opener. The cause for the humming noise is that the motor cannot start and stop.</p>
