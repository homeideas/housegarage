When the garage door opener works intermittently the logic board may be experiencing radio frequency RF interference from nearby sources such as security lights ham radios and some electronics. Its important to understand some of the most common issues before installing a new garage door so if problems do arise you can fix them fast and be on your way. If the remote works only when held within a few feet of the motor unit RF interference is probably the problem. This can be a quick fix by identifying the object and then removing it.</p>
