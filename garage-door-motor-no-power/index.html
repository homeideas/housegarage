Unlike the garage door motors of yesteryear the XTracs super quiet and powerful 24V DC motor is connected directly to the garage door and travels with it as it opens or closes. The vast majority of roller garage doors on the market have a manual release which is situated on the side of the motor.</p>

<p>The vast majority of roller garage doors on the market have a manual release which is situated on the side of the motor. Most garage doors are operated electronically by a motor that is activated from a remote and through a system of pulleys and springs which pulls the door to the open position. No more clanking chains results in a smoother and quieter ride. This also goes the same with fiberglass garage doors. A garage with no electricity presents no problem for the Hormann Promatic AKKU.</p>
