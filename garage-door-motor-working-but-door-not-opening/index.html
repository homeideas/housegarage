<p>The other possible problem is your garage door could be failing to engage with your opener. If you click your remote and hear the garage door openers motor running but the door wont open the first thing you should do is check to see that the manual release isnt engaged. Use the emergency release handle to reconnect the door. Hums Longer Than 5 Seconds. If this is the case the motor will run but as the chain isnt where it.</p>
