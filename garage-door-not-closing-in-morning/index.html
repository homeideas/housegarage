You cant leave the house with the garage door open. As soon as the door passes the sensors line the sunlight wont interfere with the beam anymore and the door will remain shut. A good way to see if this is whats wrong with your door is make sure nothing is blocking the door from closing and hold down the wall mounted button inside your garage.</p>

<p>This also disables any remotes or wireless keypads. If the light is off the sensor itself is probably off and if the light is blinking it means something is getting in the way of the signal. Garage door openers that use safety sensors safety sensors. Over the past few weeks it was getting touchy but always closed after the first try or so. If your garage door is falling down when closing you should look to replace the springs.</p>

<p>Some solutions I have heard including fashioning blinders around the sensors or swapping sides so that the receiving eye is at a different angle. This also disables any remotes or wireless keypads. The sensors have small LED lights to let you know when the signal is on and uninterrupted. Youre running late for work you hop in your car pull out of your garage hit the button on the remote control for your garage door opener but the door doesnt close. Sometimes it takes me 5 minutes of coaxing to get it to come.</p>
