<h3 id="if-your-door-still-stops-mid-way-going-down-closing-mode-try-this-it-worked-in-my-case">If your door still stops mid-way going down closing mode try this it worked in my case.</h3><p>If you see a normally functioning garage door and how it opens and closes you will find it moves on a track. I suspect there is an adjustable limit switch in the motor gear box that determines when the door should stop moving downwards just before it touches the ground with a separate limit switch to stop it in the fully open position. If you notice that your garage door is not staying closed and is instead immediately springing open again this could be because the limit switch is set too high. There is no visible barrier in the tracks or anywhere. In turn this can prevent your door from closing and locking properly compromising the security of your garage and its contents.</p>
