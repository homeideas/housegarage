<p>My ancient 1992 Genie screwdrive garage door opener does not work in. This can happen to a newly installed garage door or an older one. If your garage door is wood and it doesnt have bottom weatherstripping make sure it has been sealed or. I guess they want us to get out and freeze. I think this may have something to do with the safety system.</p>
