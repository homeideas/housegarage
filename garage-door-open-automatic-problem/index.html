<p>We have a new Toyota and when I attached the old opener to the visor with elastic bands since the visor is very thick and rigid the door wont open. If your opener is not plugged into an electrical socket it may be wired into a subpanel. To clarify if you press the button to open the door and all you hear is a grinding noise your main drive could be damaged. When your garage door opens but wont close this is the first thing to check. Sometimes a garage door wont open or close for one reason only the operator has no power connection.</p>

<p>If a garage door is hitting the ground but then reversing back up check there are no obstructions in the way of the doors path or obscuring the photo eye sensor. Theres something wrong with the garage door opener thats stopping it from opening the door for you. When your automatic garage door wont open theres a high likelihood that the problem is electrical rather than mechanical. If this happens to your door then it may have been manually locked. If the garage door opens correctly but fails to close completely there may be one of three common causes.</p>
