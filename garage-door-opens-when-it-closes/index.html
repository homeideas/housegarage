<p>Usually when your garage door becomes obnoxious to open and close that means its passed its prime. Your garage door opens when it hits the ground. Your garage door is programmed to travel a certain distance before it closes. There are safety sensors at the bottom of your garage door. This infrared sensor passes.</p>

Keep Garage Doors Closed Suspect Invades Home Through Cracked Open Garage Door We Lock Our Front Door W Garage Doors Garage Door Closer Martin Garage Doors</p>
<p>This started happening a few weeks ago. I recently bought a new house with two craftsman garage door openers. If your garage door keeps going back up after youve closed it the most common reason is because. If playback doesnt begin shortly try restarting your device. Another common reason garage doors wont open or close is when the gear in the opener breaks down which occurs over time due to wear and tear.</p>
