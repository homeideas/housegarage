<p>Its important to create a clean and smooth base for the new paint to adhere to. Lightly stir before use. 15 Nov 2005 Messages. BTW the paint i have is interior satinwood. I assumed - maybe wrongly - that it would be suitable for Garage door as meets the criteria of the product and also Dulux dont seem to have a specific garage door paint.</p>
