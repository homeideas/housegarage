<p>Our Giani Wood Look Kit for Garage Doors includes all the tools you need to makeover your garage door from start to finish. This door offers the authentic look of wood with the durability of steel. GarageSkins will allow any homeowner with a standard metal overhead garage door to add the look of a real wood carriage house door in under an hour and for less than 1000. Exterior metal siding that looks like wood is. This means faux wood doors are also easier to replace and if you lose power theyre easier to open by hand.</p>

<p>Our woodgrain fiberglass doors mimic the real appearance of beautiful wood textures such as oak mahogany and cedar so you can enjoy the beauty of wood with none of the upkeep. Its simple and it looks good. Each individual panel is flushed and fastened to a metal frame that rolls the door overhead inside the garage. A wood garage door is exactly what it sounds like a garage door made of solid wood often redwood cedar hemlock or even Douglas Fir. While some people like real wooden garage doors others choose to go with a faux wood garage door made of steel that requires less maintenance and is better in harsh weather like we have in Cache Valley.</p>
