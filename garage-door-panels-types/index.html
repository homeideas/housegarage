<p>Standard Steel Garage Doors The standard steel garage doors are the perfect type of sectional panel lift garage doors when you are looking for a secure and strong door. Usually these panels are wood or metal but could also be made of a high-quality plastic such as vinyl. Garage door panels are flat panels fitting between the stiles and rails on each individual section of the garage door. With symmetrical and non-symmetrical side hinged doors it is easy to get in and out of your garage whenever necessary without having to open the whole door. A typical sectional door for a double garage might have between eight and ten panels across and usually five hinged panels from top to bottom.</p>
