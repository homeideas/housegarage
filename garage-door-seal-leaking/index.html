Unless your garage door is falling apart we think that a good dose of weather stripping and a good paint job will stop the flood. If this is your problem you have several different options available. The best way to prevent rainwater from leaking in under a garage door is to change the flow of water itself.</p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion about the source of the leak. I think Ive tried everything. When the garage door is closed the seal should press snugly against the garage floor. As you can see in the photo there is a little light that shows through the bottom side of the garage door. Check for leaks in between garage door panels.</p>
