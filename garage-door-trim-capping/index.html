<p>If you are tired of painting those old wood frames around your garage door then let our capping specialists cover them up with aluminium. Put away your paintbrush. Wood trim around your garage door is no exception to this common process and prolonged exposure to the outer elements can lead to wood rot discoloration and structural decay. With our kit now virtually anyone can cap and cover their own door trim in less than an hour and save hundreds of dollars compared to the cost to have a contractor do the job for you. Water that gets behind the trimming can grow mold and other wood damaging effects over long periods of exposure.</p>
