You need to open the locks or latches if you have any outside your garage door and make sure they wont interfere when manually opening the door. If the latter then it has probably become detached from the release mechanism so the door will not unlatch from the outside.</p>

<p>The door could be raised with failed springs but the weight of the door could be too much for one person to lift alone - so having the assistance of someone else might be what you need to lift it. If any are outside of the track then the door has become detached. Simply hold the keypad button down for a few seconds in order to deactivate the lock mode. Find any locks or latches near the outside of the garage door and make sure theyre open so they wont interfere with you manually opening the door. The photo-eye components consist of two pieces that align face-to-face across each side of the garage door roughly four feet above the ground.</p>

<p>Jamming the garage door opener means that are locked out of your garage door. There are hardly any ways in which you can activate your garage door. Sorry for long post. Both remotes will open door from inside garage as will wall switch. I undid them and the coupling holding the opening mechanism to the door let go and I was able to manually open the door.</p>
