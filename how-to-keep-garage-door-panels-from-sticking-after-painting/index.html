<p>Its also possible that too much paint has been applied over the years causing the doors to bind when shut. I used a sanding block to take down the elevated areas of the paint on the door and jam. This will also work for shelves or mantels that need to be put back into use quickly. But many hours later sticky sticky sticky. It can take a week or so for latex paint to fully cure.</p>

<p>Of course you could try spraying some WD-40 on the backside of the stripping or apply some light oil like baby oil to keep them from sticking. Closing and reopening the door shortly thereafter does not produce the same problem as the weather seal has had not had time to stick again. Here is the one that proved the best. After the door has completely dried tap some talcum powder into a cup pick it up with a makeup brush and then lightly dust it onto the weather stripping. First make sure that the area is clean and dry.</p>
