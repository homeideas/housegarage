Help My Garage Door Is Uneven Or Sagging Creative Door</p>
<p>I am told that they are commonly referred to as an emergency release kit. However if you encounter resistance stop. Unplug the motor to disconnect the door opener from electricity. The garage door openers all seem to be working the indicator lights up when button is pressed but theres no response from the door. If my door were stuck badly enough it would certainly open under the force of the loader.</p>
