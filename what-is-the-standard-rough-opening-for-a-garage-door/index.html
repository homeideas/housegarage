For instance if your rough opening is 16 feet wide and 7 feet high then your best bet for a garage door is a 167 door. For instance if you have a 16 door and are using river stones that are approximately 2 to 2-12 you will want the rough opening to be roughly pun intended 166.</p>

<p>For instance if your rough opening is 16 feet wide and 7 feet high then your best bet for a garage door is a 167 door. The back room is the length of the garage ceiling. The rough opening sill must not be crowned or sagged. A standard single garage door rough opening is usually 8 feet wide by 7 feet tall or 9 feet wide by 7 feet tall. When referring to a rough opening this is a garage door opening.</p>

<p>You need 18 inches plus the height of the door for the back room. So if your door is 9ft wide your rough opening should be 9ft 3 inches. So in a 12-foot wide garage door the rough opening will be 15 inches wide. Non standard sized garage doors take a lot more time and cost a lot more too. Frame a few houses with a carpenter and youll see.</p>
