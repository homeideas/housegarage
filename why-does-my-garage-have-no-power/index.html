<p>Assuming I tripped the breaker I went to the panel however the breaker did not trip. We have power in our house but no power in our detached garage. 2 The National Electrical Code NEC allows it to take shutting off up to six breakers in the main service panel to turn off all power. Should be 110 to 120 volts from the breaker leg to the neutral ground if its a single pole breaker or 220 to 240 volts across the two breaker legs if its a two pole. If your home is out of power and you have no backup sources your garage will be stuck in the closed position.</p>

<p>The Operator Receives No Power. It can usually be found in the garage basement outside wall of the house and in older homes sometimes it will be located in a bathroom. In the funniest of scenarios the problem will simply be due to an unplugged power cord. So I reset the breaker and went back to the garage. Those who have experienced the convenience that an automatic garage door offers will likely never go back to a manually opening door.</p>

<p>First off I am not too familiar with electricity or exactly how it works. The power supply the unit is plugged into is fine. It can be identified by test and reset buttons on its face. The Operator Receives No Power. Its also possible that the supply to the garage has been run from one of the houses sockets circuits via a Fused Connection Unit FCU aka fused switch somewhere - if that were he case the fuse may have blown or it might even have got switched off.</p>

<p>Genie bought at Sears 10-13-08. If you have a multi meter check the circuit breaker for voltage even if it doesnt look tripped. Active 1 year 1 month ago. GFCI devices often protect the outlet circuit that is installed into the garage therefore if this device trips off then garage outlets will be affected. Have a fuse box in garage old style wire fuse one for sockets and one for light but both are ok and the unit hadnt tripped.</p>

<p>Locate a GFCI outlet in the garage and push the reset button. I checked the RCD inside the garage and it wont test it wont trip if I press test. Based on the age of your house the garage door opener might not be GFCI protected and that leads me to believe you have a loose connection somewhere. 12 horse model 2560. Its a new garage built on to the house.</p>

<p>You might have absentmindedly unplugged the operator as you were exiting the garage through your internal door to the house. The breaker did not trip but I filped it off and on I think you call that resetting the breaker - - however there still is no power. Lights do not work the little led light on back side does not work. I checked the RCD inside the garage and it wont test it wont trip if I press test. Assuming I tripped the breaker I went to the panel however the breaker did not trip.</p>
