<p>If the sensors detect something in the way they will not allow the doors to close. If you have questions about a garage door that wont close all the way or are curious about replacing your existing garage door andor opener please contact Same Day Garage Door Services at 480-660-2156. Lately my garage door doesnt want to open or close all the way. Repairing your garage door springs can be a dangerous job due to the weight of the door. If the door is very heavy then you have a spring that is broken or that has failed.</p>

<p>If the door is very heavy then you have a spring that is broken or that has failed. Wont open or close all the way When a garage door doesnt open or close all the way first check the opener alignment and adjust if needed. A misaligned garage door opener may cause the door or trolley to bind up-causing the opener to stop or reverse because opening or closing force exceeded the openers force limit. Your garage door opener is equipped with safety features that cause it to automatically reverse in the event that the garage door opener encounters resistance. With these removed it will close another 12 or so but there is still a gap.</p>

The extension springs are evenly matched and installed to keep the garage door properly aligned so that it runs smoothly throughout the entire length of the track and closes evenly. I removed the sleds and the garage door opener arm so that I could see if those were inhibiting its closing all the way. Wont open or close all the way When a garage door doesnt open or close all the way first check the opener alignment and adjust if needed. If the lights are flashing ten 10 times when the door reverses see Lights on garage door opener flash and door will not close.</p>
