<p>You say theres no power to a garage right. Some have the breakers on a side access door but this is where you should find your disconnect since turning off your main did not kill the power. When I came from my absence I noticed there was no power at all in the garage.</p>
<h3 id="gfi-outlets-commonly-found-in-garages">GFI Outlets Commonly Found In Garages.</h3><p>Its also possible that the supply to the garage has been run from one of the houses sockets circuits via a Fused Connection Unit FCU aka fused switch somewhere - if that were he case the fuse may have blown or it might even have got switched off. The electric company says that because the meter is located on the house - they cannot do anything. The breaker did not trip but I filped it off and on I think you call that resetting the breaker - - however there still is no power. Are you sure that there is not a separate consumer unit somewhere with MCBs and RCDs just for the garage. There is power to the rest of the house.</p>

<p>No power in garage. This morning started off like any other morning did - except for when I tried to leave the house. The garage has no power or water and it is probably not going to be realistically possible to run either to it. Either i have the wrong breaker or there is a hidden junction box somewhere behind the wall. If this does not restore power to the receptacles the problem may be a GFCI type receptacle has tripped and needs to be reset.</p>

As much as we would love to help them it is impossible for us to open your garage door if there is no power. Some have the breakers on a side access door but this is where you should find your disconnect since turning off your main did not kill the power. There is power to the rest of the house.</p>

<p>Either i have the wrong breaker or there is a hidden junction box somewhere behind the wall. As above my garage does not have power and is in a block of garages away from. So you shut off your main panels main breaker and your garage didnt trip. Unless of course you have a second meter but that would show up on your power bill as a 2nd service. It can be identified by test and reset buttons on its face.</p>

<p>If you have a multi meter check the circuit breaker for voltage even if it doesnt look tripped. Are you sure that there is not a separate consumer unit somewhere with MCBs and RCDs just for the garage. Some have the breakers on a side access door but this is where you should find your disconnect since turning off your main did not kill the power. There is power to the rest of the house. There was no power in my garage the garage door openers did not work nor did the lights.</p>
